Further improvement ideas for BCRMaster
=======================================

UI improvements:

* Window header should show document title
* Asterisk should mark if modified
* Could open with New empty document shown
* Tabs are really hard visually to see 
* Could show Icon somewhere if BCR is detected, and autodetect on start
* Editor could get Find, Search and Replace?
* Menu items could get enabled/disabled correctly
* Could use a few more wait progress dialogs while detecting etc.
* Could make clearer that clicking on button to the right will load preset from BCR

MIDI features
* Could allow non-autodetection definition of BCR
* Could add MIDI routing (once developed), including parameter mapping ala Matrix Mod Matrix

Librarian features
* Could allow to save all of BCR content (open all, save all?)

Editor
* Syntax Highlighting for BCL!

Visual
* Show visual layout of BCR, and show controller parameters there?
* Allow for Controller description (as comment) in BCR file, and render that in the BCRView
* Could move controllers on screen when real BCR sends messages - for easyparm that could be possible, but not for sysex?

Visual editing
* Drag and drop arrangement of controllers?
* Property window for controller? That's hard for the freeform tx stuff
